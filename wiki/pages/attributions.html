{% block lead %}Use this page to attribute work done on your project. This includes the work done by each of the student members on your team and  any work that was done by people outside of your team, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster. This requirement is not about literature references - these can and should be displayed throughout your wiki.{% endblock %}
